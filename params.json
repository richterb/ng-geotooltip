{"name":"Angular-GeoTooltip","tagline":"An AngularJS directive to display geo leaflet-based tooltips on your content","body":"### What is Angular-GeoTooltip?\r\nIt is a simple AngularJS directive that you can use in your content to display geographical tooltips when hovering your text. It can be a 2D point (latitude & longitude), a GeoJSON shape, or both. \r\n\r\nIt is designed to be smart about its positioning, so that you don't have to fight against vicious scrollbars. It is also highly configurable, both using a global configuration, or using attributes on each directive. And finally, it is designed to be used many times in the same page, by reusing its own elements instead of spawning ghost DOM nodes everywhere.\r\n\r\nAngular-GeoTooltip is based on the wonderful LeafletJS library to display tile-based maps, and can be configured to use any tile provider such as MapBox; by default it will use the free MapQuest OSM Tiles.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<geotooltip geojson=\"geoJson\" coords=\"pointCoordinates\" delay=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\">Hello, I am a tooltip!</geotooltip>\r\n```\r\n### Examples\r\nblablabla\r\nblablabla\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
